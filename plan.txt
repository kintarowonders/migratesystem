The plan to migrate systems is an algorithm which:
* Goes through the 'users' group for every user.
* For every user it moves their home directory, adds a user to the new system
	and changes permissions for the moved home directory for that user.
* Goes through every site symlink in home directories, moves that site and sets
	permission for that user.
* Moves MySQL tables for all users.
* Moves nginx configs which should point to the sites directories for all users.
